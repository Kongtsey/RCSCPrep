Part I: Comprehension
Read the following passage and answer Questions 1-5 by choosing the answer to each question. Answers
should be based on what is stated or implied in the passage.
 (The passage given below is an excerpt from Nudge – Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth and
Happiness by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein)
How much should you worry about hurricanes, nuclear power, terrorism, mad cow disease, alligator
attacks, or avian flu? How much care should you take in avoiding risks associated with each? What exactly
should you do to prevent the kind of dangers that you face in ordinary life?
In answering questions of this kind, most people use what is called the “availability heuristic”. They assess
the likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind. If people can easily think of relevant
examples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they cannot. A risk that is
familiar, like that associated with terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, will be seen as more serious than a risk
that is less familiar. Homicides are more available than suicides, and so people tend to believe, wrongly,
that more people die from homicide.
Accessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well. If you have
personally experienced a serious earthquake, you’re more likely to believe that an earthquake is likely than
if you read about it in a weekly magazine. Thus, vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example,
tornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes (for example, asthma
attacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency. So, too, recent events have a
greater impact on our behavior and on our fears, than earlier ones.
The availability heuristic helps to explain much risk-related behavior, including both public and private
decisions to take precautions. Whether people buy insurance for natural disasters is greatly affected by
recent experiences. In the aftermath of an earthquake, purchases of new earthquake insurance policies rise
sharply – but purchases decline steadily from that point, as vivid memories recede.
When “availability bias” is at work, both public and private decisions may be improved if judgments can be
made in the direction of true probabilities. A good way to increase people’s fear of a bad outcome is to
remind them of a related incident in which things went wrong; a good way to increase people’s
confidence is to remind them of a similar situation in which everything worked out for the best. The
pervasive problems are that easily remembered events may inflate people’s probability judgments, and that
if no such events come to mind, their judgments of likelihoods might be distorted downward.
