(The passage given below is an excerpt from 
Nudge 

 
Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth and 
Happiness
 
by Richard H. Thaler
 
and Cass R. Sunstein)
 
 
How much should you worry about hurricanes, nuclear power, terrorism,
 
mad cow disease, alligator 
attacks, or avian flu? How much care should you take in avoiding risks associated with each? What exactly 
should you do to prevent the kind of dangers that you face in ordinary life?
 
In answering questions of this kind, most peo

the likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind. If people can easily think of relevant 
examples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they cann
ot. A risk that is 
familiar, like that associated with terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, will be seen as more serious than a risk 
that is less familiar. Homicides are more available than suicides, and so people tend to believe, wrongly, 
that more people 
die from homicide. 
 
Accessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well. If you have 

if you read about i
t in a weekly magazine. Thus, vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example, 
tornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less
-
vivid causes (for example, asthma 
attacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far great
er frequency. So, too, recent events have a 
greater impact on our behavior and on our fears, than earlier ones.  
 
The availability heuristic helps to explain much risk
-
related behavior, including both public and private 
decisions to take precautions. Wheth
er people buy insurance for natural disasters is greatly affected by 
recent experiences. In the aftermath of an earthquake, purchases of new earthquake insurance policies rise 
sharply 

 
but purchases decline steadily from that point, as vivid memories rece
de.
 

made in the direction of true probabilities. 

remind them of a related incident in whi

confidence is to remind them of a similar situation in which everything worked out for the best.
 
The 

that 
if no such events come to mind, their judgments of likelihoods might be distorted downward.
