                  The passage given below is excerpts from Advice to Graduates Past and Present
                  by Erik Hanson.
For sorne of yorg graduation has finally arrived. Touching on the different aspects of one's life,
the following is some of the most enduring (and memorable) advice given to graduates over the
!'ears-
Michael Dell is the founder of Dell. During a 2003 commencement speech at the University of
Texas, he said the following:
"Don't spend so much time trying to choose the perfect opportunity that you miss the right
opportunity. Recognize that there will be failures, and acknowledge that there will be obstacles.
But you will learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others, for there is very liffle learning
in success.'
Jon Huntsman was the Govemor of Utah and a U.S. Ambassador to China. During a 20lI
commencement speech at the University of South Carolina, he said the following:
"Remember others. The greatest exercise for the human heart isn't jogging or aerobics or weight
lifting     i1'5 reaching down and lifting another up. Find a cause larger than yourself, then speak
        -
out and take action. Never let it be said that you were too timid or too weak to stand by your
camse. Learn what it feels like to give 100 percent to others. It'll change your life."
Steve Jobs said the following during a2005 commencement speech at Stanford:
*Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent; it clears out the old
to make way for the new. Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you
will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma,
which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your own inner voice, heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you
truly want to become. Everything else is secondary ... stay hungry, stay foolish."
So take heed this graduation season, and ponder the advice that gets passed along to you. Much
like the words of wisdom provided above, most good advice is based on another person's time
and experience, both of which are invaluable resources and gifts. And with any luck, someday
you will be the one passing down some knowledge of your own to a recent college graduate.

                  The passage given below is excerpts from Advice to Graduates Past and Present
                  by Erik Hanson.
For sorne of yorg graduation has finally arrived. Touching on the different aspects of one's life,
the following is some of the most enduring (and memorable) advice given to graduates over the
y€zrrs-
Michael Dell is the founder of Dell. During a 2003 commencement speech at the University of
Texas, he said the following:
"Don't spend so much time trying to choose the perfect opportunity that you miss the right
opportunity. Recognize that there will be failures, and acknowledge that there will be obstacles.
But you will learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others, for there is very liffle learning
in success.'
Jon Huntsman was the Govemor of Utah and a U.S. Ambassador to China. During a 20lI
commencement speech at the University of South Carolina, he said the following:
"Remember others. The greatest exercise for the human heart isn't jogging or aerobics or weight
lifting     i1'5 reaching down and lifting another up. Find a cause larger than yourself, then speak
        -
out and take action. Never let it be said that you were too timid or too weak to stand by your
camse. Learn what it feels like to give 100 percent to others. It'll change your life."
Steve Jobs said the following during a2005 commencement speech at Stanford:
*Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent; it clears out the old
to make way for the new. Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you
will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma,
which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your own inner voice, heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you
truly want to become. Everything else is secondary ... stay hungry, stay foolish."
So take heed this graduation season, and ponder the advice that gets passed along to you. Much
like the words of wisdom provided above, most good advice is based on another person's time
and experience, both of which are invaluable resources and gifts. And with any luck, someday
you will be the one passing down some knowledge of your own to a recent college graduate.
