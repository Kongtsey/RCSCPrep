First AOL and Time Warner announced their intention to combine. Then came Time
Warner/EMI and Tribune/ Times Mirror. Even more significant, however, has been the
speculation that these mergers have caused: If these transactions are consummated, a large
number of additional media mergers are expected. There is even the possibility of a nightmare
scenario-a wave of media mergers so large that within a decade most of our information will be
supplied by perhaps six of these huge conglomerates and a fringe of much smaller firms.
It's time to ask two critical questions. Is this kind of media oligopoly what we, as a society,
want? And if not, can the anti-trust laws effectively prevent the threatened merger wave? The
answer to the first question is clear. We do not want a media oligopoly. The answer to the second
question, however, is far less certain. We should distrust a media oligopoly because it would give
undue control to a small number of individuals. This need not manifest itself in a price rise for
the daily newspaper or AOL's monthly fee. Rather, it could consist of a change in editorial
viewpoints, a shift in the relative prominence of links to certain websites or a decision not to
cover certain topics, because they are not ""newsworthy"". These problems could exist without any
improper intent on the part of the media barons. Even if they try to be fair and objective, they
will necessarily bring their own worldview to the job. And in time some of these conglomerates
may be controlled by people who are not fair or objective.

Answers should be based on what is stated or implied in the passage.(The passage given below is excerpts from Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis and WhyWe Lie by Robin Lloyd).  It was the famous Greek philosopher and cynic Diogenes who went around the streets of Athens,lantern in hand, looking for an honest person.This was over two thousand years ago, but I would presume that Diogenes would have as little success in his search today. Lying seems to be an integral weakness of mortal character – I doubt that few human beings would be so brash as to claim that they have never in their lives told at least a partial untruth. Indeed, one philologist goes so far as to theorize that language must have been invented for the sole purpose of deception. Perhaps so. It is certainly true that animals seem somewhat more honest than humans, maybe because they are less gifted mentally. Why do people lie? To increase their sense of importance, to escape punishment, to gain an end that would otherwise be denied them, out of long standing habit, or sometimes because they actually do not know the difference between facts and fancy. These are the common reasons for: We all lie, all the time. It causes problems, to say the least. So why do we do it? ""It's tied in with self-esteem,"" says University of Massachusetts psychologist Robert Feldman. ""We find that as soon as people feel that their self-esteem is threatened, they immediately begin to lie at higher rates. Not all lies are harmful. In fact, sometimes lying is the best approach for protecting privacy and ourselves and others from malice, some researchers say. Some deception, such as boasting and lies in the name of tact and politeness, can be classified as less than serious. But bald-faced lies(whether they involve leaving out the truth or putting in something false), are harmful, as they corrode trust and intimacy—the glue of society.""We're trying not so much to impress other people but to maintain a view of ourselves that is consistent with the way they would like us to be,"" Feldman said. We want to be agreeable, tomake the social situation smoother or easier, and to avoid insulting others through disagreement or discord. Men lie no more than women, but they tend to lie to make themselves look better,while women are more likely to lie to make the other person feel better. People should become more aware of the extent to which we tend to lie and that honesty yields more genuine relationships and trust. ""The default ought to be to be honest and accurate ... We're Better off if honesty is the norm. It's like the old saying: honesty is the best policy.""   ", Men’s tendency to lie revolves around,True,,,,,,

Answer Should be based on what is stated or implied in the passage. (The passage given below is an excerpt from Nudge – Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth andHappiness by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein)  How much should you worry about hurricanes, nuclear power, terrorism, mad cow disease, alligatorattacks, or avian flu? How much care should you take in avoiding risks associated with each? What exactly should you do to prevent the kind of dangers that you face in ordinary life? In answering questions of this kind, most people use what is called the “availability heuristic”. They assess the likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind. If people can easily think of relevant examples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they cannot. A risk that is familiar, like that associated with terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, will be seen as more serious than a riskthat is less familiar. Homicides are more available than suicides, and so people tend to believe, wrongly,that more people die from homicide.Accessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well. If you have personally experienced a serious earthquake, you’re more likely to believe that an earthquake is likely than if you read about it in a weekly magazine. Thus, vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example,tornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes (for example, asthma attacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency. So, too, recent events have a greater impact on our behavior and on our fears, than earlier ones.The availability heuristic helps to explain much risk-related behavior, including both public and private decisions to take precautions. Whether people buy insurance for natural disasters is greatly affected by recent experiences. In the aftermath of an earthquake, purchases of new earthquake insurance policies rise sharply – but purchases decline steadily from that point, as vivid memories recede.When “availability bias” is at work, both public and private decisions may be improved if judgments can be made in the direction of true probabilities. A good way to increase people’s fear of a bad outcome is to remind them of a related incident in which things went wrong; a good way to increase people's confidence is to remind them of a similar situation in which everything worked out for the best. The Pervasive problems are that easily remembered events may inflate people’s probability judgments, and that if no such events come to mind, their judgments of likelihoods might be distorted downward", Which two words best explain the words “pervasive” and “vivid” as used in the passage?,True,,,,,,

It was the famous Greek philosopher and cynic Diogenes who went around the streets of Athens,lantern in hand, looking for an honest person.This was over two thousand years ago, but I would presume that Diogenes would have as little success in his search today. Lying seems to be an integral weakness of mortal character – I doubt that few human beings would be so brash as to claim that they have never in their lives told at least a partial untruth. Indeed, one philologist goes so far as to theorize that language must have been invented for the sole purpose of deception. Perhaps so. It is certainly true that animals seem somewhat more honest than humans, maybe because they are less gifted mentally. Why do people lie? To increase their sense of importance, to escape punishment, to gain an end that would otherwise be denied them, out of long standing habit, or sometimes because they actually do not know the difference between facts and fancy. These are the common reasons for: We all lie, all the time. It causes problems, to say the least. So why do we do it? ""It's tied in with self-esteem,"" says University of Massachusetts psychologist Robert Feldman. ""We find that as soon as people feel that their self-esteem is threatened, they immediately begin to lie at higher rates. Not all lies are harmful. In fact, sometimes lying is the best approach for protecting privacy and ourselves and others from malice, some researchers say. Some deception, such as boasting and lies in the name of tact and politeness, can be classified as less than serious. But bald-faced lies(whether they involve leaving out the truth or putting in something false), are harmful, as they corrode trust and intimacy—the glue of society.""We're trying not so much to impress other people but to maintain a view of ourselves that is consistent with the way they would like us to be,"" Feldman said. We want to be agreeable, tomake the social situation smoother or easier, and to avoid insulting others through disagreement or discord. Men lie no more than women, but they tend to lie to make themselves look better,while women are more likely to lie to make the other person feel better. People should become more aware of the extent to which we tend to lie and that honesty yields more genuine relationships and trust. ""The default ought to be to be honest and accurate ...

How much care should you take in avoiding risks associated with each? What exactly should you do to prevent the kind of dangers that you face in ordinary life?

66,v8lJ0mUgFAcJRuLOVpSz,Comprehension,"[' are not at all sufficient to deal with issues relating to large scale media mergers.', ' can prevent mergers from happening.', ' will be effective if properly interpreted.', ' favour a particular company or group of companies.']",0,False,False,"Part I: Comprehension Direction: Read the following passage and answer the questions. Answers should be based on the information given in the passage. The passage given below is from http://www.2iim.com/india_mba_iim_cat_faq/rc.  First AOL and Time Warner announced their intention to combine. Then came Time Warner/EMI and Tribune/ Times Mirror. Even more significant, however, has been the speculation that these mergers have caused: If these transactions are consummated, a large number of additional media mergers are expected. There is even the possibility of a nightmare scenario – a wave of media mergers so large that within a decade most of our information will be supplied by perhaps six of these huge conglomerates and a fringe of much smaller firms.It's time to ask two critical questions. Is this kind of media oligopoly what we, as a society,want? And if not, can the anti-trust laws effectively prevent the threatened merger wave? The answer to the first question is clear. We do not want a media oligopoly. The answer to the second question, however, is far less certain. We should distrust a media oligopoly because it would give undue control to a small number of individuals. This need not manifest itself in a price rise for the daily newspaper or AOL's monthly fee. Rather, it could consist of a change in editorial viewpoints, a shift in the relative prominence of links to certain websites or a decision not to cover certain topics, because they are not ""newsworthy"". These problems could exist without any improper intent on the part of the media barons. Even if they try to be fair and objective, they will necessarily bring their own worldview to the job. And in time some of these conglomerates may be controlled by people who are not fair or objective.At first it might appear that the antitrust laws can be of little help in grappling with the issues presented by large media mergers. The anti-merger laws are commonly understood as protecting price competition and a relatively small number of firms - to greatly oversimplify, let's say at most half a dozen - are normally thought to be enough to keep a market price - competitive. In Industry after industry, firms merge until there is only a handful left, and the antitrust enforcers are normally unable to do anything to prevent this. (In former years mergers were governed by an ""incipiency"" standard that prevented mergers and merger waves well before they would have led to very large or likely anti-competitive problems.) Even if a handful of firms are enough to ensure effective competition in most industries, would six conglomerate media firms be sufficient for the diversity of viewpoints necessary to democracy? Would we be reassured if they could somehow guarantee that they would sell their magazines and internet advertisements at competitive prices?I am hopeful that the anti-trust laws, if correctly and vigorously interpreted, are adaptable enough to meet this challenge. This is because anti-trust is not exclusively about price. It is essentially about choice - about giving consumers a competitive range of options in the marketplace so that they can make their own, effective selection from the markets’ offerings. Consumers should be able to make their choices along any dimension important to them - including price, variety and editorial viewpoint. Communications media compete in part by offering independent editorial viewpoints and an independent gatekeeper function. Six media firms cannot effectively respond to the demand for choice or diversity competition by extending their product lines, because new media products will inevitably bear, to some degree, the perspective of their corporate parent. For these reasons competition in terms of editorial viewpoint or gate-keeping can be guaranteed only by ensuring that a media market contains a significantly larger number of firms than is required for price competition in other, more conventional markets.It is unclear, however, whether this interpretation of the antitrust laws will be applied by the enforcement agencies and the courts. What is needed, therefore, is a much more careful look at the challenges that will be raised by future media mergers. This could best be accomplished if Congress created a Temporary Committee to Study MediaMergers and Media Convergence. This committee could include members of Congress, the heads of the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Justice Department's antitrust division, CEOs of media companies, and the representatives of consumer groups. The committee would identify problems that may be caused by large media mergers and by media convergence. If the committee concludes that existing antitrust laws are inadequate, it should recommend to Congress that new anti-merger legislation be enacted.
