1. A foundry has a fixed daily cost of Rs. 50,000 whenever it operates and a
variable cost of Rs. 800Q, where Q is the daily production in tonnes. What is
the cost of production in Rs. per tonne for a daily production of 100 tonnes?
A. 1,30,000
B. 1300
C. 80,000
D. 50,00,000
Solution:
Fixed cost of production per day = Rs. 50,000
Variable Cost of production per day = 800 Q, where Q is the daily production in
tonnes.
Total cost of production per day = 50,000 + 800 Q
Given, Q= 100
So, total cost of production on that day
=50,000+800(100)
= 1, 30,000
130000
Now, cost of production per tonne that day
= Rs. 1300
=
100
