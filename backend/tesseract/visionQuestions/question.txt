B. Nu. 140
C. Nu. 60
D. Nu. 160
Solution:
'Premium' means an amount of money paid to get insurance. (For example; Car insurance
premiums have increased this year. The premiums for healthcare plans are high.)
The share value is Nu. 100 and the premium is 60% of the share value. 60% of Nu.100
is Nu.60. So, in total a subscriber shall pay Nu.160.
94. A landmark in North America passes through a longitude of 450 West and
has a local time of 7:00 hours. What will be the time in Paro fortress in
Bhutan in 24 hours format?
A. 15:00 hours
B. 16:00 hours
C. 17:00 hours
D. 18:00 hours
Solution:
The landmark is 450 West meaning the time at it will be 3 hours late than that of
London. Paro is yet another 90° east of London. This means additional 6 hours from
London. So, when it is 7:00 at the Landmark in North America, it must be (3 + 6) hours
ahead of it in Paro. This is 16:00 hours in 24 hours format.

34. Look at the figure below:
Total number of blocks in total when a 12-step staircase is completed is:
A. 55
B. 70
C. 78
D. 96
Solution:
From the figure, to complete the first stair, one block is required. To complete the
second stair, two blocks are needed. Three is needed to complete the third stair and the
trend continues. So, to complete the 12th stair, 12 blocks will be required.
So, the total number of blocks required to complete the staircase would be
1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12,
=78 blocks.
Other Method;
This question is related to sequence and series. It is in arithmetic progression since only
one block increases for each next stair.
a = 1, d = 1, n = 12
We are asked to find S12
We know, Sn = [2a + (n - d)]
[2 x 1 +(12 - 1)]

Page 71 of 228
Solution:
Time taken by Wangpo to finish the work=4 days,
In 1 day, he can finish=1/4 of the total work,
In the similar way, Tashi and Karma can finish 1/3th and 1/7th of the total work
respectively in a day.
When they unite and work, they can finish/4+1/3+ 1/7 of the total work in one day.
.i.e. 61/84 of the total work in a day,
So, they will take 84/61 days to complete the work which is 1.37 days.

61. A is 2 years older than B while B is twice as old as C. The sum of their ages
is 27. How old is B?
A. 5 years
B. 10
years
C. 15 years
D. 20 years
Solution:
Let the ages of A, B and C be a, b and c respectively.
Given a = 2 + b
(1)
b = 2c
(2)
Now, a + b + c = 27
Putting (1) and (2) in the above equation:
2 + b + 2c + c = 27
Which is,
2 + 2c + 2c + c = 27
5c + 2 = 27
C= 5
Now, putting c = 5 in (2)
b = 10
So we conclude that the age of B is 10years.
Cross-Checking the answer;
C=5, b= 10. Now we get a=12, (2+b).
Given condition; a+b+c=27
.i.e. 12+10+5=27
27=27
So, our solution is correct.

10 men working 8 hours a day can complete the work in 12 days. If we say, only 5 men
work for same 8 hours, the number of days taken to complete the work will double, 24
days.
(By 5 men) 8 hours = 24 days
1 hour = (24x 8) days -
- (1)
Second condition:
men are working only 2 hours a day. We are asked to find the number of days taken
by them.
Equation (1) is also based on 5 men.
So, (5 men) 2 hours = days

85. In a night party of 59 persons, 30 are dancing while 23 are drinking. 5 of
them are dancing and drinking at the same time. Find the number of
persons who are neither drinking nor dancing.
A. 10
B. 11
C. 13
D. 16
Solution:
It is not stated that 30 are only dancing and 23 are only drinking. So the 5 who are
dancing and drinking at the same time are included in these 23 drinkers and 30 dancers.
So, number of only dancers are 25 (30 - 5) and only drinkers are 18 (23 - 5). So those
engaged either in dancing or drinking are 25+18+5 which is 48. Now,
Those who are neither drinking nor dancing = Total persons - sum of those who are
either drinking or dancing.
.i.e. 59 - 48 which is 11.

Let the present age of daughter be ‘. From the question, the present age of father is 2d.
It is no doubt that the age of daughter after 10 years will be d+10 and father's 2d+10.
But we have got more information on their ages after 10 years. The ratio of their ages
after 10 years will be 5:3.
Ratio of the age of father to daughter after ten years= 5:3
From the table we also know the ratio will be = (2d+10) : (d+10)
The two of the above are same
5:3 = (2d+10) : (d+10)
It is same as,
2d + 10
3 d + 10
By cross-multiplying;
5(d+10 = 3(2d+10)
d=20, which is the present age of daughter.
Now the present age of the father is 2d
5
= 40 years.
So, the present ages of the father and daughter are 40 and 20 years respectively.

10. There were 20 questions in a multiple choice section in an examination
paper. Phuntsho gets 10 marks for each correct answer and loses 5 marks for
each wrong answer. He observes that he scored 155 out of 200. How many
questions did he answer wrongly?
A. 5
B. 3
C. 4
D. 6
Solution:
We need to frame equations for such a question. Let x and y be the number of
questions answered correctly and wrongly by Phuntsho respectively. Since the total
number of questions is 20, total questions answered by him will also be 20.
x + y = 20
x= 20 -y -
(1)
He gets 10 marks for each correct answer and loses 5 marks for each wrong answer.
The total mark he gets is 155. So an equation can be framed as below:
10x-5y = 155
(2)
Using (1) in (2)
10 (20 -y) - 5y =155
y = 3
We have assumed y as the number of questions he answered wrongly. So the number of
answers he answered wrongly is 3.
Answer Cross-Check
In this kind of questions, we can also cross-check the answer to confirm if our solution
is right. If he has answered 3 questions wrong, then he must have definitely answer 17
questions correctly. So, this must conform to the equation (2).
10x-5y = 155; here our x=17 and y=3,
Applying these values in equation (2);
10 (17) - 5 (3) =155,
170 - 15 =155
155 =155; the terms on the left and right are equal meaning our solution is correct.

25. Drakpa pays 50% of his monthly income as house rent and 25% as his loan
repayment. He spends Nu. 2,000 on food and drinks. He still saves Nu.
5,000 per month and keeps in his locker. What is Drakpa's monthly income?
A. Nu. 14,000
B. Nu. 20,000
C. Nu. 35,000
D. Nu. 28,000
Solution:
This question demands a simple logic and ability to be a bit smart.
In total he spends 75% of his income on house rent and loan repayment. Now the
leftover is 25%.
He spends 2,000 on food and drinks and finally saves 5,000 monthly.
We should understand that the last 25% (that we didn't include as house rent and loan
repayment)are the sum of his expenditure on food and drinks, and his monthly savings.
This is 7,000.
So, 25% comes out to be 7,000.
His monthly income must be hundred percent,
Therefore, 25% X 4 = 100%
Likewise, 7,000x 4 = 28,000
His monthly salary is Nu. 28,000

29. When a heavy object is lifted under water, it is easier to lift than lifting the
same object in the air. Which of the following provides the best reason for
this?
A. When the object is immersed in the water, the water absorbs some of the
weight of the object. Thus the weight of the object decreases.
B. When an object is immersed in water, some weight of the object is lost on
the surface of the water thereby reducing the weight of the object in water.
C. When an object is immersed in water, the gravitational force of the earth acts
in the opposite direction that is upward force.
D. When an object is immersed in water, it experiences an upward thrust and
loses weight equal to the water displaced by the immersed object and hence
becomes lighter.
(Ans. D)

10M+10N?
A. 10
B. 4
C. 100
D. 200
Solution:
Given equation is M+N=20-------- (1)
To find
10M + 10 N=? ---- (2)
What do we observe and learn from the two equations above? We notice that all the
terms in the first equation is being multiplied by 10 to get equation (2). For the equation
to be correct, the answer-part of equation (1) must be also multiplied by the same
number, 10.
Now the answer comes out to be 200.
6. The price of a shirt increased 8 points, then decreased 13 points, and then
increased 9 points. If the price of the shirt at first was S, which of the
followings was the shirt's price after all the changes?
A. S+5
B. S-5
C. S+4
D. S-3
Solution:
Original price of the shirt is S.
At first, the price increased by 8. The cost then is S + 8.
It then decreased by 13. The cost after this decrease is S + 8 – 13
Finally, the cost increased by 9. The final cost will be S + 8 – 13 + 9 which is same as
S+4.

1. A foundry has a fixed daily cost of Rs. 50,000 whenever it operates and a
variable cost of Rs. 8000, where Q is the daily production in tonnes. What is
the cost of production in Rs. per tonne for a daily production of 100 tonnes?
A. 1,30,000
B. 1300
C. 80,000
D. 50,00,000
Solution:
Fixed cost of production per day = Rs. 50,000
Variable Cost of production per day = 800 Q, where Q is the daily production in
tonnes.
Total cost of production per day = 50,000 + 800 Q
Given, Q=100
So, total cost of production on that day
=50,000+800(100)
= 1, 30,000
Now, cost of production per tonne that day =
= Rs. 1300

Solution:
We can say that the two elements are added and the result is multiplied with the first
element. This results to the element right to the equal sign.
First, 2+3=5 and 5x 2(first term) = 10.
Likewise, 3+5=8 and 8 X 3(first term) =24. Now what we need is 6+11=17 and
17X6=102

48. On working 12 hours a day, a work is completed in 16days by 24 men. How
many days can the same work be done by 8 men considering they work only
6 hours a day?
A. 69 days
B. 100 days
C. 78 days
D. 96 days
Solution:
First scenario:
24 men can complete a work in 16days working 12 hours a day.
...e. 24 men = 16 days (considering they work 12 hours daily)
If they work only half the time .i.e. 6 hours daily, the time taken to finish the work
would be double the time they take now. They would take 32 days.
.e. 24 men = 32 days (considering they work 6 hours daily)
1 man = (32 X24) days
(1)
Now, the question asks us to find the time that would be taken to complete the same
work by 8 men considering they work 6 hours daily.
Modifying (1):
32x24
8 men =
days
8
= 96 days
49. What decimal of an hour is second?
A. 0.36
B. 0.0036
C. 0.00027
D. 0.000060
42. The sum of ages of five children born at the intervals of 3 years each is 50
years. What is the age of the youngest child?
A. 3 years
B. 4 years
C. 5 years
D. 7 years
Solution:
Let the ages of five children be X, X+3, X+6, X+9 and X+12; their intervals are 3
years.
Given, sum of ages of all children is 50.
.i.e. X+ (X+3) + (X+6) + (X+9) + (X+12) = 50
5X + 30 =50
X = 4
Since X in the assumption is the age of the youngest child, the age of the youngest child
is 4 years.
Cross-Checking the answer;
X+ (X+3) + (X+6) + (X+9) + (X+12) = 50
Using X=4;
4+7+10+13+16 = 50
50 =50
The value of X=4 fulfils the equation. So our solution is correct.

52. There are 24 persons attending a workshop in Gasa. For every 9 males there
are 3 females. How many males and females are there attending the
workshop?
A. 20 males and 4 females
B. 15 males and 9 females
C. 18 males and 6 females
D. 19 males and 5 females
Solution:
Total persons are 24. Let the number of male be 'm' and female be 'P respectively. The
number of males are 3 times the number of females. So m=3f.
Total,
m + f= 24
Or,
(3f) + f =24; since for every female, there are 3 males.
4f = 24
f=6
Then, m = 3(0) = 18
So, there are 18 males and 6 females. We can also check the answers by seeing if the
answers conform to the given conditions.
53. A number of artists are called in a museum. 15 of them only do pencil
sketching while 10 do both pencil sketching and oil painting. Only 5 do oil
painting. How
many artists were there in total?
A. 25
B. 30
C. 20
D. 35
Solution:
Peljor needs to reach office at 9:00AM.
Time taken by him to cook and eat = 50 minutes
Time taken to reach school = 45 minutes
Total time taken = 50+45 = 95 minutes (one hour 35 minutes). This means that to
reach his office on time he must wake up 1 hour and 35 minutes before 9:00AM which
is 7:25AM.
