73. Tashi felt bored in his math class. He had 20 pencils in his pencil box. He
broke each pencil into half and threw five of the broken pencils. How many
pencils are left with him?
A. 30
B. 35
C. 40
D. 45
Solution:
Total pencils = 20
When all are broken into halves, the number of pencils would double, 40.
Out of 40 broken pencils, 5 are thrown.
The leftover = 40 - 5
= 35 pencils.

Problem Solving Exercise
We know Bhutan is located at 90°E of London while Tokyo is at 135°E. This means
Tokyo is 3 hours ahead of Bhutan's time (since 45° difference would mean 3 hours time
difference).
Earth rotates one round in 24 hours. This means it rotates 15º each hour because it
rotates 360° in 24 hours.
I.e. 24 hours =360°
1 hour = 15°
Now, time in Delhi is 7:30 AM.
Since Delhi is half an hour behind Bhutan's time, time in Bhutan must be 8:00AM
Now, we know Tokyo is 3 hours ahead of Bhutan time; it must be 11:00AM in Tokyo
then.

A. 15%
B. 30%
C. 6.67%
D. 5.78%
Solution:
From the question, we understand that 15 is a certain percent of 225. Let us assume that
the certain percent be X.
Now, we get the equation 15=X % of 225
On further solving the equation
X
15 =
X 225

11. Tashi is making a Thugpa (Porridge) in the morning on a Losar (New Year
Festival). He also wants to make a tea. He needs 8/9 glass of water for
Thugpa and 2/5 glass of water for tea. He has a glass of water. How much
extra water is needed by him?
A. 0.12 glass of water
B. 1.5 glass of water
C. 0.79 glass of water
D. 2.5 glass of water
Solution:
Quantity of water needed for making Thugpa= 8/9 glass
Quantity of water needed for making tea = 2/5 glass
2
5
Total quantity of water required = +
: 1.29 glass
He already has 1/2 glass of water,
So the quantity of water required = 1.29 - 0.5 (1/2 glass of water is same as 0.5 glass of
water).
= 0.79 glasses is required.

40. If B>2, then compare i and ii: i) B-6 ii) B-3
A. i>ii
B. i<ii
C. i =ii
D. Can't be determined.

Since B is greater than 2, let us assume B=3, or you can even take 4, 5, and higher.
I.B - 6 = 3 - 6
= -3.
II. B-3=3 - 3

Solution:
68. Kezang stole two bags from a shop in Thimphu. One bag, A, contains a
kilogram of apple while the other, bag B, contains a kilogram of cotton.
Which statement below is NOT true?
A. A is heavier than B
B. There were apples and cottons in the two bags
C. The bags were stolen by Kezang
D. Kezang was the thieve in above incidence
Solution:
One bag contains apple and the other cotton. By just reading without serious
concentration, one may mistake by thinking that cotton is much lighter than the apple.
However, it is clear that both cotton and apple in different bags are of one kilogram
each which means both the bags are equal in weight. So, all the statements are correct
except A.

58. To fill Lhendup's stomach, three plates of rice are required. If the size of his
plate is reduced to 2/3 of his original plate size, how many plates (new size)
of rice are required to fill his stomach?
A. 2 plates
B. 3.5 plates
C. 4 plates
D.' 4.5 plates
2
3
Solution:
Let us assume the original size of the plate to be 9 units. (Any number can be taken).
9 units = 3plates
(1)
Now, his plate is reduced by 2/3 of the original size
x9 = 6 Units --- (2)
From (1), 9 units = 3plates
1 unit = 3x 9 plates (if the size of the plate is reduced, he would eat
more).
So,
6 units = plates
= 4.5 plates

What is her speed in kilometres per hour?
A. 5.7
B. 6.8
C. 7.2
D. More than 10
Solution:
Her speed is 600metres per minute. Converting both distance into kilometres and time
into hour, the new unit of her speed is worked out as below:
Distance, 1000m = 1km
1m = 1/1000 km
600
600m = km
1000
= 0.6km
Time 60 minute = 1 hour
1 min = 1/60 hours
5
5 min = -hours
60
= 0.083 hours
Speed is distance divided by time

35. There are 12 buses and 8 cars. Each car carries 3 passengers while each bus
carries 20 passengers except 3 buses which carry 18 passengers each. The
ratio between the number of passengers carried by bus to the total number
of passengers is:
A. 250:250
B. 236:259
C. 235:250
D. 234:258
Solution:
Car:
There are total 8 cars. Each car carries 3 passengers. So the total passenger carried by all
8 cars is 8X 3 = 24.
Bus:
Total number of bus is 12. Out of 12, only 3 buses carry only 18 passengers each
(18x 3) while the rest 9 buses carry 20 passengers each (9x 20). So the total passenger
carried by all buses is (18x 3) + (9x 20) = 234.
Now, total passenger carried by both buses and cars
= 24 + 234
= 258
The ratio between the number of passengers carried by bus to the total number of
passengers is 234: 258

20. Merak is at a time where it is losing its language's significance. However,
people over there also speak English. If 60% of the Merakpas (people of
Merak) speak English and 70% of them speak their own language (Brami),
what is the minimum percentage of English speaking Merakpas that also
speak Brami
A. 20%
B. 30%
C. 40%
D. 60%
Solution:
The use of Venn diagram makes the job easy in this kind of questions. It is basic logic
that the total percent is always 100. The rule here is that Merakpas speaking only English,
only Brami and both must be 100%.
English Brami
(60-?)%
?
(70-?)
From the above diagram,
The minimum number of Merakpas speaking both English and Brami will be;
(60-?)% + (70-?)% +3% = 100%, this is because the total Merakpas speaking only
English, only Brami and both must be 100% in total.
So, 130% -P% =100%
?% = 30%.

Let the number of apples bought by each friend be A.
There was a shortage of five apples in the party.
3 A + 5 = 50
3A = 45
A = 15

A. 50 plates and 28 cups
B. 45 plates and 33 cups
C. 57 plates and 21 cups
D. 60 plates and 18 cups
Solution:
Since the ratio of plates to cups is 10:3,
10X + 3X = 78; number of plates is 10X and cups 3X.
X = 6
Number of plates (6 multiplied 10) is 60 and cups is 18(6 multiplied 3).

26. Vijay, a tourist, wants to go back home to India from Paro to Bagdogra,
India. He has two options to reach Bagdogra from Paro. He can either travel
by air which takes 30 minutes or by taxi which takes 10 and half hours. The
air ticket costs him Nu. 5000 and the taxi fare is Nu. 1250. Other things
remaining constant, Vijay would gain by choosing air travel if, and only if,
his time were valued at more than:
A. Nu. 370 per hour
B. Nu. 375 per hour
C. Nu. 280 per hour
D. Nu. 385 per hour
Solution:
Here, we need to calculate the time-value of money. One option takes him more time to
reach his destination but cuts down his travel cost while the other reaches him faster
but is of higher cost.
First option: By taxi
Time to be taken = 10 and half hours
Ticket fare = Nu. 1250
Second option: By air
Time to be taken = 30 minutes
Ticket fare = Nu. 5000
3750
Extra time taken by taxi = 10 hours
Extra money charged for air travel = 3750
So, the money value of time offered by air service = = Nu. 375 per bour. Now
we can say that Vijay would gain from travelling by flight only if his time is valued more
than Nu.375 per hour. At Nu. 375 per hour, it is same as travelling by taxi. At less than
Nu.375 per hour, he gains from travelling by taxi.

people in country X as in country Y. Taking both countries together, what is
the percentage of people taller than 6 ft?
A. 3.0
B. 2.5
C. 1.5
D. 1.25
Solution:
Assume any number as the population of X and that of Y should be 1/3 of X.
Let population in country X be 300 & 100 in Y. (Assume population of X any number
but the Y's population must be 1/3 of the X. This is the condition in the question).
So, 3 people out of 300 in country X are taller than 6ft & 2 out of 100 people in country

So, overall 5 people in 400 are taller than 6ft.
So,% = (5/400) x100 = 1.25

54. An umbrella seller had certain number of umbrellas. He sold 30% of his total
umbrella yet is left with 553 more in hand. How many umbrellas did he have
in total in the beginning?
A. 820
B. 680
C. 790
D. 930
Solution:
Umbrellas sold = 30% of the total.
Number of leftover umbrellas = 553
If umbrellas sold are 30% of the total (100%), then the leftover must be 70%, (100% -
30%).
So,
if 70% = 553 umbrellas
553
1% = umbrellas
70
553
Now,
30% =
x 30
70
=237 umbrellas
Now, total number of umbrellas
= total umbrellas sold + leftover umbrellas
= 237 +553
= 790 umbrellas
