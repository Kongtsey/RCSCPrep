Is this kind of media oligopoly what we, as a society,\nwant? And if not, can the anti-trust laws effectively prevent the threatened merger wave? The\nanswer to the first question is clear. We do not want a media oligopoly. The answer to the second\nquestion, however, is far less certain. We should distrust a media oligopoly because it would give\nundue control to a small number of individuals. This need not manifest itself in a price rise for\nthe daily newspaper or AOL's monthly fee. Rather, it could consist of a change in editorial\nviewpoints, a shift in the relative prominence of links to certain websites or a decision not to\ncover certain topics, because they are not \"newsworthy\". These problems could exist without any\nimproper intent on the part of the media barons. Even if they try to be fair and objective, they\nwill necessarily bring their own worldview to the job. And in time some of these conglomerates\nmay be controlled by people who are not fair or objective.\nAt first it might appear that the anti-trust laws can be of little help in grappling with the issues\npresented by large media mergers. The anti-merger laws are commonly understood as protecting\nprice competition and a relatively small number of firms - to greatly oversimplify, let's say at\nmost half a dozen - are normally thought to be enough to keep a market price - competitive. In\nindustry after industry, firms merge until there is only a handful left, and the anti-trust enforcers\nare normally unable to do anything to prevent this. (In former years mergers were governed by\nan \"incipiency\" standard that prevented mergers and merger waves well before they would have\nled to very large or likely anti-competitive problems.) Even if a handful of firms are enough to\ninsure effective competition in most industries, would six conglomerate media firms be sufficient\nfor the diversity of viewpoints necessary to democracy? Would we be reassured if they could\nsomehow guarantee that they would sell their magazines and internet advertisements at\ncompetitive prices?\nI am hopeful that the anti-trust laws, if correctly and vigorously interpreted, are adaptable enough\nto meet this challenge. This is because anti-trust is not exclusively about price. It is essentially\nabout choice - about giving consumers a competitive range of options in the marketplace so that\nthey can make their own, effective selection from the markets\u2019 offerings. Consumers should be\nable to make their choices along any dimension important to them - including price, variety and\neditorial viewpoint.\nCommunications media compete in part by offering independent editorial viewpoints and an\nindependent gatekeeper function. Six media firms cannot effectively respond to the demand for\nchoice or diversity competition by extending their product lines, because new media products\nwill inevitably bear, to some degree, the perspective of their corporate parent. For these reasons\ncompetition in terms of editorial viewpoint or gate-keeping can be guaranteed only by insuring\nthat a media market contains a significantly larger number of firms than is required for price\ncompetition in other, more conventional markets.\nIt is unclear, however, whether this interpretation of the anti-trust laws will be applied by the\nenforcement agencies and the courts. What is needed, therefore, is a much more careful look at\nthe challenges that will be raised by future media mergers.\nThis could best be accomplished if Congress created a Temporary Committee to Study Media\nMergers and Media Convergence. This committee could include members of Congress, the heads\nof the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Justice\nDepartment's anti-trust division, CEOs of media companies, and the representatives of consumer\ngroups. The committee would identify problems that may be caused by large media mergers and\nby media convergence. If the committee concludes that existing anti-trust laws are inadequate, it\nshould recommend to Congress that new anti-merger legislation be enacted.
