    "passage": "Part I: Comprehension\nRead the following passage and answer Question 1-5 by choosing the answer to each question.\nAnswers should be based on what is stated or implied in the passage.\n(The passage given below is excerpts from Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis and Why\nWe Lie by Robin Lloyd).\nIt was the famous Greek philosopher and cynic Diogenes who went around the streets of Athens,\nlantern in hand, looking for an honest person.\nThis was over two thousand years ago, but I would presume that Diogenes would have as little\nsuccess in his search today. Lying seems to be an integral weakness of mortal character \u2013 I doubt\nthat few human beings would be so brash as to claim that they have never in their lives told at\nleast a partial untruth. Indeed, one philologist goes so far as to theorize that language must have\nbeen invented for the sole purpose of deception. Perhaps so. It is certainly true that animals seem\nsomewhat more honest than humans, maybe because they are less gifted mentally. Why do\npeople lie? To increase their sense of importance, to escape punishment, to gain an end that\nwould otherwise be denied them, out of long standing habit, or sometimes because they actually\ndo not know the difference between facts and fancy. These are the common reasons for\nWe all lie, all the time. It causes problems, to say the least. So why do we do it? \"It's tied in with\nself-esteem,\" says University of Massachusetts psychologist Robert Feldman. \"We find that as\nsoon as people feel that their self-esteem is threatened, they immediately begin to lie at higher\nNot all lies are harmful. In fact, sometimes lying is the best approach for protecting privacy and\nourselves and others from malice, some researchers say. Some deception, such as boasting and\nlies in the name of tact and politeness, can be classified as less than serious. But bald-faced lies\n(whether they involve leaving out the truth or putting in something false), are harmful, as they\ncorrode trust and intimacy\u2014the glue of society.\n\"We're trying not so much to impress other people but to maintain a view of ourselves that is\nconsistent with the way they would like us to be,\" Feldman said. We want to be agreeable, to\nmake the social situation smoother or easier, and to avoid insulting others through disagreement\nor discord. Men lie no more than women, but they tend to lie to make themselves look better,\nwhile women are more likely to lie to make the other person feel better.\nPeople should become more aware of the extent to which we tend to lie and that honesty yields\nmore genuine relationships and trust. \"The default ought to be to be honest and accurate ... We're\nbetter off if honesty is the norm. It's like the old saying: honesty is the best policy.\"\n"
