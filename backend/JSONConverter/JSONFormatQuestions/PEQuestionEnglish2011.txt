    "Passage": "Part I: Comprehension\nRead the following passage and answer Questions 1-5 by choosing the answer to each question. Answers\nshould be based on what is stated or implied in the passage.\n (The passage given below is an excerpt from Nudge \u2013 Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth and\nHappiness by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein)\nHow much should you worry about hurricanes, nuclear power, terrorism, mad cow disease, alligator\nattacks, or avian flu? How much care should you take in avoiding risks associated with each? What exactly\nshould you do to prevent the kind of dangers that you face in ordinary life?\nIn answering questions of this kind, most people use what is called the \u201cavailability heuristic\u201d. They assess\nthe likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind. If people can easily think of relevant\nexamples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they cannot. A risk that is\nfamiliar, like that associated with terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, will be seen as more serious than a risk\nthat is less familiar. Homicides are more available than suicides, and so people tend to believe, wrongly,\nthat more people die from homicide.\nAccessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well. If you have\npersonally experienced a serious earthquake, you\u2019re more likely to believe that an earthquake is likely than\nif you read about it in a weekly magazine. Thus, vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example,\ntornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes (for example, asthma\nattacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency. So, too, recent events have a\ngreater impact on our behavior and on our fears, than earlier ones.\nThe availability heuristic helps to explain much risk-related behavior, including both public and private\ndecisions to take precautions. Whether people buy insurance for natural disasters is greatly affected by\nrecent experiences. In the aftermath of an earthquake, purchases of new earthquake insurance policies rise\nsharply \u2013 but purchases decline steadily from that point, as vivid memories recede.\nWhen \u201cavailability bias\u201d is at work, both public and private decisions may be improved if judgments can be\nmade in the direction of true probabilities. A good way to increase people\u2019s fear of a bad outcome is to\nremind them of a related incident in which things went wrong; a good way to increase people\u2019s\nconfidence is to remind them of a similar situation in which everything worked out for the best. The\npervasive problems are that easily remembered events may inflate people\u2019s probability judgments, and that\nif no such events come to mind, their judgments of likelihoods might be distorted downward.\n   1.

    "Passage": "Part I: Comprehension\nRead the following passage and answer Questions 1-5 by choosing the answer to each question. Answers\nshould be based on what is stated or implied in the passage.\n (The passage given below is an excerpt from Nudge \u2013 Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth and\nHappiness by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein)\nHow much should you worry about hurricanes, nuclear power, terrorism, mad cow disease, alligator\nattacks, or avian flu? How much care should you take in avoiding risks associated with each? What exactly\nshould you do to prevent the kind of dangers that you face in ordinary life?\nIn answering questions of this kind, most people use what is called the \u201cavailability heuristic\u201d. They assess\nthe likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind. If people can easily think of relevant\nexamples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they cannot. A risk that is\nfamiliar, like that associated with terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, will be seen as more serious than a risk\nthat is less familiar. Homicides are more available than suicides, and so people tend to believe, wrongly,\nthat more people die from homicide.\nAccessibility and salience are closely related to availability, and they are important as well. If you have\npersonally experienced a serious earthquake, you\u2019re more likely to believe that an earthquake is likely than\nif you read about it in a weekly magazine. Thus, vivid and easily imagined causes of death (for example,\ntornadoes) often receive inflated estimates of probability, and less-vivid causes (for example, asthma\nattacks) receive low estimates, even if they occur with a far greater frequency. So, too, recent events have a\ngreater impact on our behavior and on our fears, than earlier ones.\nThe availability heuristic helps to explain much risk-related behavior, including both public and private\ndecisions to take precautions. Whether people buy insurance for natural disasters is greatly affected by\nrecent experiences. In the aftermath of an earthquake, purchases of new earthquake insurance policies rise\nsharply \u2013 but purchases decline steadily from that point, as vivid memories recede.\nWhen \u201cavailability bias\u201d is at work, both public and private decisions may be improved if judgments can be\nmade in the direction of true probabilities. A good way to increase people\u2019s fear of a bad outcome is to\nremind them of a related incident in which things went wrong; a good way to increase people\u2019s\nconfidence is to remind them of a similar situation in which everything worked out for the best. The\npervasive problems are that easily remembered events may inflate people\u2019s probability judgments, and that\nif no such events come to mind, their judgments of likelihoods might be distorted downward.\n   1. What role does the bolded and italicized sentence play in the passage?\n       A. It is the conclusion\n       B. It states an assumption\n       C. It contradicts the topic under discussion\n       D. It states the impossible\n   2. Which of the following best describes the word \u201cheuristic\u201d?\n          A.   Theoretical knowledge\n          B.   Rule of thumb\n          C.   Dynamics\n          D.   Common sense\n   3. The whole passage is about the phenomenon of:\n          A.   Making good judgments based on past and recent experiences\n          B.   Keeping risk-related behavior a total mystery\n          C.   Selecting which public and private decisions to make\n          D.   Discerning risks based on experiences that easily come to mind\n   4. What would influence people to buy insurance?\n          A.   Events that occur occasionally\n          B.   An event that occurred 5 years ago\n          C.   An event that occurred recently and can be remembered vividly\n          D.   A disease that has high probability\n   5. Which two words best explain the words \u201cpervasive\u201d and \u201cvivid\u201d as used in the passage?\n          A.

Pervasive means \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and vivid means \u201cscarlet\u201d\n          D.   Pervasive means \u201crestrictive\u201d and vivid means \u201ccolorless\u201d\nPART II: Grammar\n   6.
